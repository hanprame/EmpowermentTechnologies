ipconfig / ifconfig Exercise: Run ipconfig on your machine. What is your machine's IP address and subnet mask? Compare it with your seatmate.

My Machines IP Address: 192.168.0.35 Ping Latency: Packets: sent=4, received = 0, Lost = 4(100% Lost),

ping Exercise: Get your seatmate's IP address and ping it. What was the ping latency?

My seatmates IP Adress: 192.168.0.35 Ping Latency: Packets: sent = 4, received = 0, Lost = 4(100% Lost),

ping the following web sites:

www.telkom.co.za (South African telecommunications company) www.singtel.sg (a Singaporean telecommunications company) www.pldt.com.ph (a Philippine telecommunications company) www.att.com (a US telecommunications company)

Telkom Ping statistics for 165.143.151.45: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 491ms, Maximum = 492ms, Average = 491ms

Singtel Ping statistics for 203.127.23.18: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 386ms, Maximum = 399ms, Average = 394ms

PLDT Ping statistics for 210.14.4.124: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),

Akamai Edge Ping statistics for 184.84.55.130: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 81ms, Maximum = 82ms, Average = 81ms

tracert / traceroute Exercise: Do a traceroute for each of the four websites you pinged in the previous exercise. Which has the most, and which has the least number of hops? For each traceroute, identify the bottleneck (takes the longest time) hop.

Descending order speed rank

1.PLDT - Average : 26ms(our broadband connection speed) 2.Akamai Edge - Average : 81ms 3.Singtel - Average :394ms 4.Telkam - Average :491ms

whois Exercise: For each of the hops in the traceroute output to www.singtel.sg, run a whois. Determine the location (country) of each IP address in the hop. Do the same analysis for the traceroute output to www.att.com. Based on your analysis, explain which network connection is faster, and why.

Singtel country: Singapore Akamai Edge country: United States

netstat Exercise: Run netstat on your machine. You might need to press Ctrl-C to stop netstat.

From the netstat output, what are the remote machines that you're connecting to?
